# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I built this webpage because I am a new coding student, and to work through building a webpage on my own is a fundamental part of understanding how a developers mind works. I was motivated to build this study guide webpage for two things: to have my notes on new concepts transcribed in one location for myself to reference but also to be able to explore concepts that had previously been so foreign to me. This was a wonderful way of opening up my mind a little bit into a window of the coding world, and I am beginning to really comprehend how things work. 
I certainly ran into some hiccups along the way-- coding is all about the details; my first issue ended up being me missing a space in the code! At one point I had to start over completely to understand where I went wrong. I learned that so much of coding is a domino effect, and to not move on from something that I don't think is right, just to get it done. There is no rushing this process if you want to be successful; coding takes time, patience (lots of it), and a keen eye for minute details.

## Usage

As you can see on the page, there are four sections of topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section details important notes for each language to refer to as you progress in your coding journey. If you right click anywhere and select "inspect" the DevTools will appear on the right and you can see our JavaScript is running and selecting a different topic at random each time you refresh the page.
